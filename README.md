# 🏴‍☠️ One Piece – A Small Sail Through My Thoughts

This was a spontaneous side quest — a random idea turned into a mini website inspired by the world of **One Piece**. Just like Luffy's journey, this project wasn't planned — it just *happened*. ⚓

## 🌊 What's Inside?
A simple, fun tribute to the legendary anime. Expect:
- Some cool pirate vibes
- Random touches of creativity
- No big purpose — just for fun!

## 🚀 Why?
Sometimes, your brain yells "let's build something" — and this was that something. No roadmap, no pressure, just a breeze through a fun idea.

## 🧭 Tech Stack
- HTML / CSS / JS

## 🍖 Bonus
If you're a fellow Straw Hat fan, I hope this makes you smile. If not... maybe it still does?
